# 2.5DC KRaft Migration with Dynamic Quorum (KIP-853)

Example YAMLs for migrating a 2.5DC multi-region cluster from ZooKeeper to KRaft
using dynamic quorum (KIP-853). Requires CFK 3.3.0+ and CP 7.9.6+.

> **This is the recommended target for 2.5DC migrations.** Dynamic quorum enables
> `add-controller` / `remove-controller` and `force-standalone` disaster recovery (static quorum
> cannot `remove-controller`), and during migration the bootstrap voter forms the quorum on its
> own — so quorum formation does not wait for a cross-region voter majority, avoiding the
> static-quorum minority-region wedge. See the
> [2.5DC migration overview](../README.md#recommended-target-kraft-with-dynamic-quorum-kip-853).

## How dynamic quorum differs from static quorum

In static quorum, all KRaft controllers start as voters with a fixed
`controllerQuorumVoters` list. In dynamic quorum:

- **One controller is the bootstrap voter** (`bootstrapPod: 0` on DC1 KRC).
  It starts the quorum standalone.
- **All other controllers start as observers.** They join the quorum but
  cannot vote until promoted.
- **Observers are promoted to voters** during DUAL-WRITE using
  `kafka-metadata-quorum --bootstrap-controller <endpoint> add-controller`.

## Key configuration

All KRaftControllers require:
- `dynamicQuorumConfig.enabled: true`
- `advertisedListenersEnabled: true` — without this, voters advertise internal
  `svc.cluster.local` addresses and cross-cluster `add-controller` fails
- `controllerQuorumVoters` listing ALL controllers across all DCs — the migration
  driver needs the full list to know the expected quorum size

Only the bootstrap voter (DC1 kraft-east) has:
- `dynamicQuorumConfig.bootstrapPod: 0`
- `podTemplate.serviceAccountName: kraftcontroller-sa` (for bootstrap ConfigMap access)

## Bootstrap resources (DC1 only)

The `bootstrap/` directory contains resources needed only in the bootstrap voter's namespace:
- `bootstrap-configmap.yaml` — tracks whether the bootstrap voter has completed initial
  formatting. The init container reads this to decide between `--standalone` (first time)
  and `--no-initial-controllers` (rejoining).
- `rbac.yaml` — ServiceAccount and RoleBinding for the bootstrap voter pod to read/update
  the ConfigMap.

## Migration steps

1. Deploy ZooKeeper (all 3 DCs) and Kafka (DC1 + DC2)
2. Deploy bootstrap ConfigMap + RBAC in DC1 namespace
3. Fetch `clusterID` from Kafka broker and set on the 0.5DC KRaftController
4. Deploy KRaftControllers in all 3 DCs
5. Deploy KRaftMigrationJobs in **all DCs** — all KMJs must be applied for migration to
   proceed. With dynamic quorum the bootstrap voter forms the quorum on its own and the other
   controllers join as observers, so the reason every KMJ is required is that **DUAL-WRITE is
   cluster-wide**: it cannot begin until every region's brokers are in migration mode, and
   each region's controllers stay in HOLD until that region's KMJ runs. See the
   [MRC migration sequencing](../README.md#mrc-migration-sequencing) section for approaches
   to protect availability during the concurrent broker rolls.
6. Wait for all regions to reach `DUAL-WRITE`
7. **Promote observers to voters** — run `add-controller` for each observer:
   ```bash
   kubectl exec kraftcontroller-east-0 -n east -- \
     kafka-metadata-quorum --bootstrap-controller <bootstrap-endpoint>:9074 \
       --command-config /tmp/admin.properties \
       add-controller --controller-id <id> --controller-directory-id <dir-id>
   ```
   Get `controller-id` and `controller-directory-id` from:
   ```bash
   kafka-metadata-quorum --bootstrap-controller <endpoint>:9074 \
     --command-config /tmp/admin.properties describe --replication
   ```
8. Finalize migration **one region at a time** — trigger finalization in the first region
   and wait for it to reach `COMPLETE` before proceeding to the next.
9. Release CR locks and clean up ZooKeeper
